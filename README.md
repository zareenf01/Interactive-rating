# Interactive-rating

## Overview

This is a nice small project where I've build an intractive rating component card to practice handling user interactions and updating the DOM.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating
